Hi and welcome to another episode of All Around Azure. Today, Senior Program Manager, (and Former Azure Cloud Advocate) Anthony Chu talks to us about a variety of topics in including Azure Static Web Apps and shows off a couple of fresh demos around Durable Functions, Codespaces, and Custom Handlers.

We'll Also take a peak a Learn module introducing us to Azure Durable Functions and see if we can uncover an even better understanding of the topic covered in the show.

*Interview highlights:*
- Overview of Static Web Apps followed by how to deploy them.
To get thing started, I asked Anthony to give us a real quick overview of what Azure Static Web Apps are followed by what the process looks like to deploy them.

- Using Apex domains (it's coming) including a free SSL cert
One request Anthony's team gets all the time is about how to manage Apex domains. In other words, domains or URLS that don't require the WWW. Let's see what Anthony has to say about that.

- Integrated authentication - without doing anything
Authentication is always a challenge, especially for static web apps. However, as Anthony will show us, it's super easy to integrate authentication.

- Demos to see some of this come together
Finally it's time to see an app in action. Anthony shows off a client side app - a game that allows multiple people to draw on a shared page. He'll then go on to show improvements around deploying from multiple branches in the same repository. And last, we'll  ake a look at GitHub Actions. Check this out.

- Question from our audience regarding what options are available in the Functions settings for Static Web Apps
Throughout All Around Azure, we encourage our audience to ask questions in chat on Learn TV. Let's listen in on Anthony's response to available Functions settings within Azure Static Web Apps. 

- Question from audience regarding CORS errors while calling an in-service function using the .NET 5 Release Candidate
Another great question came up from our audience in chat about CORS errors while calling a function. CORS can be a real pain in the "you know what" sometimes. Let's see what Anthony has to suggest.

- Where to give feedback and submit issues (their GitHub repo) (Azure/static-web-apps <-- file an issue
One thing we pride ourselves on is the ability to connect our live audience with the ones who build our Azure services. Anthony is a great example of that. Azure Static Web Apps is still in "preview" and all feedback is welcome. Let's listen to what Anthony has to suggest about providing feedback and submitting issues.

- An overview and update on Durable Functions including patterns such as "fan-out and fan-in" (use for interview)
Next, I asked Anthony to give our audience an overview and a bit of an update on Durable Functions, including some of the most popular use patterns.
Let's take a look at a couple of demos that really help illustrate the capabilities of Durable Functions.

- Question regarding when is the Aggregator pattern (Pattern 6) a good use case?
Now that we've seen first hand how the fan-out/fan-in pattern works, our audience has questions about other patterns, such as the Aggregator pattern. Let's see what Anthony has to say about one of our audience questions.

- Really fresh project he's been hacking on to use Fan out/Fan in for Javascript tests
We always feel lucky here at All Around Azure when we get to be amongst the first to see a new demo. This show is no different. Anthony now shows us a really fresh project he's been hacking on to use the Fan-out/Fan-in pattern for JavaScript tests.

- Question on using headless Chrome to save a web page as a PDF - point to Anthony's blog post
The demo that Anthony showed us sparked even more great questions in chat. Let's see what Anthony's response was to a question about using headless Chrome to save a web page as a PDF.

- Taking a quick look at Codespaces including a demo
With only a few minutes left in our show, Anthony shifts gears to show us Codespaces and how easy it is to start developing straight from within GitHub.

- A quick update on Custom Handlers that let you run any language in Azure Functions Go and Rust work
Before we go, Anthony shares with us a quick update on a really new project that lets you run any language in Azure Functions. Let's listen in to see how we could start running something like Go or even Rust, in an Azure Function.

Thank you for joining us. 
Until next time, I'm Jason Hand and this is All Around Azure.
