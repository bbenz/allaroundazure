In this session Jason will build a Serverless Incident Management with Logic Apps. Starting from scratch Jason will create a Logic Apps and by iteration add multiple steps to the process. By getting trigger by an event our Incident Manager will create a ticket in Azure DevOps, assign it to the person who's in support, create a conversation in Teams. Finally, Jason will add a ton of useful information in both the ticket and the conversation to make sure the assigned resource starts with all he needs.
