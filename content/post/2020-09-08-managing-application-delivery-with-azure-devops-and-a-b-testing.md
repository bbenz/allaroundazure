In this episode, April is joining Frank for a deep dive into automating and continuously deploying your application using Azure Services. This session will use [DevOps principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/devops/testing?WT.mc_id=allaroundazure-blog-apedward) to show how operations and developer teams can work together to safely automate those tedious and manual tasks to deliver their application in Azure.  Starting with automating our build and deployment of a web application, backend service, and database. Adding in automated operations to include A/B testing and automating approvals for a successful deployment.

Building a Deployment Pipeline, April will demos how simple it is to incude these [best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-best-practices?WT.mc_id=allaroundazure-blog-apedward) to our development cycle. Pintch of YAML, a few clicks and voila!
